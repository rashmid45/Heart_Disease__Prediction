# Kmeans_Clustering_Customer_Data

A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the 
market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the 
companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the ecommerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like 
previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on. 

Scope:
● Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights about the purchase pattern
● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
● Segmenting customer based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’) with the help of silhouette score
